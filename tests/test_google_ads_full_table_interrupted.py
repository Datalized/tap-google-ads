        Scenario: A job is interrupted during full table replication. The state is saved with
                  `currently_syncing`. The next sync job picks back up on `currently_syncing` stream.

        Expected State Structure (incremental):
            state = {'currently_syncing': ('<stream-name2>', '<customer-id>'),
            'bookmarks': {

                '<stream-name2>': {'<customer-id>': {'<replication-key>': <incomplete-bookmark-value>}},

        Test Cases:
         - Verify an interrupted sync can resume based on the `currently_syncing` and stream level bookmark value.
         - Verify only records with replication-key values greater than or equal to the stream level bookmark are
           replicated on the resuming sync for the interrupted stream.
         - Verify the yet-to-be-synced streams are replicated following the interrupted stream in the resuming sync.
             (All yet-to-be-synced streams must replicate before streams that were already synced. - covered by unittests)
